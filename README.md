## **To Do**
* No pet bar or stance bar yet. Will add this as an auto-hiding pull-out at some point in the future.
* No raid frames yet, but fully compatible with Blizzard and other addons.
* No custom class resource system yet, but fully compatible with **SimpleClassPower** (see link below) which provides all of these.

## **Additional addons for testers:**
Since this is a work in development, and not every feature will be included in the finished user interface anyway, there's a selection of my all-purpose addons that I recommend using along with this. I am using all of them, and the development is based on people having them. I also highly recommend **Immersion**, as it really fits the feel and style and experience of this user interface.

Of these only really **SimpleClassPower** is highly needed, as there are no class resource system built into this alpha level user interface yet. Nor is there a castbar, but I don't need one, so I leave that one to you. These recommendations are not all the missing pieces, they are just what I personally use.
