## Recommended Addons
There's a selection of my own all-purpose addons that I recommend using along with DiabolicUI. I am using all of them, and the development is based on people having them. I also highly recommend Munks brilliant addon **Immersion**, as it really fits the feel and style and experience of this user interface.

## Extensions
The UI can be externally tampered with through third party addons, and unlike its previous versions, this one encourages it! Currently only a few of my own extensions exist, but I hope to both make many more myself and see multiple ones from other authors as well.

The idea of these extensions is to add features I don't want cluttering up the base version and modifications and edits that only suit a few, without having the base version grow to a bloated monstrosity of settings and confusing menus.
