## **Recommended Addons:**
Since this is a work in development there's a selection of all-purpose addons that I recommend using along with this. I am using all of them, and the development is based on people having them. I also highly recommend **Immersion**, as it really fits the feel and style and experience of this user interface.

Of these only really **SimpleClassPower** is highly needed, as there are no class resource system built into this alpha level user interface yet. Nor is there a castbar, but I don't need one, so I leave that one to you. These recommendations are not all the missing pieces, they are just what I personally use.
